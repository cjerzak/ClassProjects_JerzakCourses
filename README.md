# Student Projects Showcase - Connor Jerzak’s Courses 

This page collects projects created by students in [Connor Jerzak](https://connorjerzak.com/teaching/)’s courses and highlights data assets and code repositories associated with those projects.  Wherever possible, links are provided to GitHub repositories or Hugging Face datasets so that other learners can explore the work.

## Additional data asset

- **LLM Debiasing Benchmark** – a Hugging Face dataset that accompanies the paper *Benchmarking Debiasing Methods for LLM‑based Parameter Estimates*.  It contains texts and large‑language‑model (LLM) annotations drawn from four corpora (Bias in Biographies, Misinfo‑general, Amazon Reviews and GermEval18) and uses four different models (DistilBERT + logistic regression, Phi‑4, DeepSeek v3 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet)https://huggingface.co/datasets/nicaudinet/llm-debiasing-benchmark/raw/main/README.md#:~:text=%23%20Dataset%20Card%20for%20LLM.  The dataset includes annotations and experiment files in separate foldershttps://huggingface.co/datasets/nicaudinet/llm-debiasing-benchmark/raw/main/README.md#:~:text=%23%20Dataset%20Card%20for%20LLM.
